The goal of clustering is to determine the intrinsic groups in unlabeled data. The question is: what constitutes a good cluster? It can be shown that there is no absolute “best” criterion for cluster validation. Consequently, it is the user who must supply the criterion for validating the cluster. For example, we might be interested in finding representatives of homogeneous instances for finding the “natural clusters” and identifying their unknown properties ( like “natural” data types), for finding appropriate groupings or in finding unusual(which are different from all other data) data objects (outlier detection).

K-Means Clustering

It was proposed by Stuart Lloyd at the Bell Labs in 1957 as a technique for pulse-code modulation, but it was only published outside of the company in 1982, in a paper titled _“Least square quantization in PCM”._By then, in 1965, Edward W. Forgy had published virtually the same algorithm, so K-Means is sometimes referred to as Lloyd-Forgy.

K-Means is a clustering approach in which the data is grouped into K distinct non-overlapping clusters based on their distances from the K centres. The value of K needs to be specified first and then the algorithm assigns the points to exactly one cluster.
